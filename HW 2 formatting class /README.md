<h1 id="purpose"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Purpose</h1>
<p>The primary goal of this assignment is to get more practice with Java, while working in the context of a simple object-oriented design. A secondary goal is to think carefully about tests and test coverage.</p>
<h1 id="description"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Description</h1>
<p>To complete this assignment, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncomment the <code>format</code> method signature in the interface.</li>
<li>Implement the method in the appropriate place(s). Your implementation <strong>must not</strong> use any of the string replacement methods such as <code>replace</code> or <code>replaceAll</code>. (Also, while recursion is lovely, I strongly suggest that you <em>not</em> use recursion to process a string.)</li>
<li>Uncomment the example tests.</li>
<li>Add additional tests as needed to exercise every non-trivially distinct possibility.</li>
<li>Make sure your code compiles and all tests pass.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="grading-standards"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Grading Standards</h1>
<p>For this assignment, you will be graded on</p>
<ul>
<li>whether your code implements the specification (functional correctness),</li>
<li>the comprehensiveness of your test coverage, and</li>
<li>how well you follow the <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">style guide</a>.</li>
</ul>
